# Kubernetes infrastructure for Google Cloud

Kubernetes infrastructure designed to get you up and running in no time. Provides all the necessary components for running your projects: Kubernetes, NGINX ingress, cert-manager, container registry, databases, database proxies, networking, monitoring, and permissions. Use it either as a module, or as an example for your own customized infrastructure.

This module is used by Taito CLI [infrastructure templates](https://taitounited.github.io/taito-cli/templates#infrastructure-templates). See the [gcp template](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/taito-templates/tree/master/infrastructure/gcp/terraform) as an example on how to use this module.
